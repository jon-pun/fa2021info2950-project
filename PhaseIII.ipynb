    "- How we’re going to do it: We are going to make a new data frame. It will have these twelve columns: [Country, HDI from 2019,  average annual GHG emissions for each economic sector between 2014-2019 ( 5 columns), average annual change in GHG emissions for each economic sector between 2014-2019 (another 5 columns)]. We will then make a heatmap of the spearman correlation between each variable in the data frame. The reason we use spearman is because we care more about a country's relative HDI and GHG compared to other countries rather than what the actual values are. We will pay specific attention to the correlation between HDI and annual GHG emissions. This will represent five cells in the heat map, each cell being a correlation between emissions from a single sector and HDI. We will also check to see any strong correlations between other variables, such as HDI and change in emissions, and correlation between emissions in separate sectors. With these correlations we will be able to make statements about the relationship between the variables in this dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What we expect to find: We expect that there will be a strong positive correlation between HDI and GHG emissions suggesting that developed countries release more greenhouse gases. Conversely, we expect a strong negative correlation between HDI and change in GHG emissions suggesting that less developed countries are where most of the industrial growth is occurring. When looking at sectors specifically, we expect a slight negative correlation between HDI and GHG emissions from bunker fuel since developing countries often export their goods to developed countries. Finally we expect a high correlation between emissions from each sector, suggesting that countries that have high emissions in one sector also have high emissions in other sectors. Scatter plots of the data, done outside of this analysis, will allow us to see more specific relationships between sectors by country. The information we will gather from this analysis does not directly pertain to the fashion industry, but the knowledge it gives us about the relationship between development and emissions will help us understand if the relationship between development and environmental impact from fashion has unique characteristics.  \n",

    "# Analysis Two\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal: Examine the relationship between HDI and the importance of the fashion industry in a country’s economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How we’re going to do it: We are going to make a new data frame with these columns: [Country, HDI, cotton, clothing, garments, textiles]. The HDI column will be downloaded from the United Nations Development Programme, and we will just use the most recent year. Cotton, clothing, garment, and textiles will have data taken from the industries list from the CIA factbook. This page shows the top industries by annual output for every country, and we are looking at industries that are just related to fashion. In the data frame these columns will house values representing what rank that industry has in that country. For instance, textiles is fourth in the list of industries in Argentina, so the textiles value for Argentina will be 4. First we will find the correlation between HDI and fashion industries ranking. Next we will merge this data with the data relating to emissions from analysis one. We will create multiple scatter plots of industry rank versus emissions and change in emissions, with different emissions sectors for each plot, and then cluster the data. We expect the clusters to relate to HDI, so we will then make histograms of the HDI per cluster and determine if the clusters correspond to a country’s stage of development. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What we expect to find: We expect to find a negative correlation between HDI and the importance of fashion in a country’s economy. Based on our knowledge that most clothing is manufactured in developing countries, we expect developing countries to rely more on the fashion industry for their economies than developed countries. Across the scatter plots we expect to see clusters of high HDI countries where importance of fashion is low, and change in emissions is low, and where importance of fashion is low, but absolute emissions are high. For low HDI countries, we expect clusters where importance of fashion is high and change in emissions is high, and where importance of fashion is high and emissions are medium to low. Our data does not take into account the size of each country, so the clusters in the annual emissions plots might represent country size, but we expect the clusters in the scatter plots of change in emissions to definitely represent development. With this information we will be able to determine if less developed countries bear a greater burden from the fashion industry than developed countries. \n"
