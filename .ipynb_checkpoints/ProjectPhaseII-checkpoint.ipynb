To do this we found data from the non-profit Climate Watch that lists greenhouse gas emissions by country, by year, over a number of industries. Using this data we will answer the following question: **How does the impact of the fast fashion industry vary across countries based on the development of a country?**\n",

Some files contain data before this windown, but to keep our obesrvations consistent we will not take these values into account. "
