    "With our project we want to compare the environmental impacts of the fashion industry across countries, particularly paying attention to the differences observed between developed and developing countries. To do this we found data from the non-profit Climate Watch that lists greenhouse gas emissions by country, by year, over a number of industries. Using this data we will answer the following question: **How does the impact of the fast fashion industry vary across countries based on the development of a country?**\n",

Some files contain data before this windown, but to keep our obesrvations consistent we will not take these values into account. "
